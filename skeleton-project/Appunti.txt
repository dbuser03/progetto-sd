The most suitable class to manage concurrency in this codebase is the Collection
class.

Here's why:

    Document Access: The Collection class directly manages the addition,
    retrieval, update, and deletion of documents (Document objects). Any
    concurrent access to these operations could lead to data inconsistencies.
    Fine-grained Locking: By encapsulating concurrency control within
    Collection, you can implement fine-grained locking mechanisms. This allows
    locking specific documents within a collection instead of locking the entire
    database. Data Consistency: By managing concurrency in Collection, you can
    ensure that modifications to the same document are handled sequentially,
    preventing issues like lost updates or dirty reads.


Here's why the other classes wouldn't be ideal choices for managing concurrency
in this codebase:

Database Class:

    Coarse-grained Locking: The Database class manages the entire collection of
    documents. Implementing concurrency control here would lead to
    coarse-grained locking, meaning the entire database would be locked for any
    operation on a document. This can significantly impact performance,
    especially for concurrent access to different collections. Focus on
    Collection Management: The primary responsibility of the Database class is
    managing collections, adding, removing, and retrieving them. Concurrency
    control for individual documents belongs within the Collection class.

Document Class:

    Limited Scope: The Document class represents a single data entity and
    doesn't have control over adding, removing, or updating documents within a
    collection. Concurrency issues arise during these operations, which are
    managed by the Collection class.

ProtocolHandler Class:

    High-Level Interaction: The ProtocolHandler class interacts with the user's
    input and translates it into database operations. It doesn't directly manage
    document access. The concurrency logic should reside within the class
    responsible for manipulating the data (i.e., Collection).

In summary, while these other classes play important roles in the system, the
Collection class is the most logical place to manage concurrency control because
it directly handles document access and modifications, allowing for fine-grained
locking and ensuring data consistency.
